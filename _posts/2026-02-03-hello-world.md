# Hey there! I'm Aditya a quasi-programmer from Kochi, India. Welcome to my blog!

I know what you're thinking—"[sigh] another one of these code/philosophy blogs." And I agree with you. But that's the way it's supposed to be. Imagine what a city made of utilitarian concrete blocks would look like. **BORING.** What about when it is interspersed with gardens and parks? The gardens all have more or less the same trees and birds but they're beautiful all the same.

The internet was supposed to be for us. Not for us to work for and be enslaved by the algorithms of big corporations(cliched but true!). But for us to express our beautiful thoughts and create change from our tiny garden (website!). Myself included (especially myself!), I feel like we've become too complacent, too comfortable with consumption. When did we all become such good puppets. This blog is my attempt at tipping the balance towards creation.

### What I Write About
I write about anything and everything—all the random thoughts I have, interesting observations made, cool rabbit hole detours and stuff that I found confusing. Hey, if I thought about X, there's decent chance someone else did too.

Expect some provocative content—not because I'm naturally provocative and confrontational (quite the opposite) but all of us are. Fitting in with social norms requires the shedding of these provocative thoughts—and for good reasons but that makes us—not us and I want to be me and see everyone for themselves! 

Probably should not have to say this but we live in such times: **zero ai was/is/will be involved in the production of these essays.** ---

Would love to get opinions and discussions on any of my posts. Happy reading!
